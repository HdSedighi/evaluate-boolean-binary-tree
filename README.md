# Intuition
<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->
The problem requires evaluating a full binary tree where each node is either a leaf node or has exactly two children. Leaf nodes represent boolean values, while non-leaf nodes represent boolean operations. The key intuition is to use a recursive approach to evaluate the tree, leveraging the natural hierarchical structure of the tree to apply operations from the leaves up to the root.

# Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->
1. Tree Traversal: Perform a recursive traversal of the tree starting from the root node.
2. Base Case: If a node is a leaf (i.e., it has no children), return its boolean value directly.
3. Recursive Case: For non-leaf nodes, recursively evaluate the left and right children.
If the node's value is 2, return the logical OR of the evaluations of the left and right children.
If the node's value is 3, return the logical AND of the evaluations of the left and right children.
4. Edge Cases: Ensure that the node values conform to the given constraints (leaf nodes having values 0 or 1, and non-leaf nodes having values 2 or 3).
# Complexity
- Time complexity:
<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->
The time complexity is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree. Each node is visited exactly once during the recursive traversal.

- Space complexity:
<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->
The space complexity is O(h), where h is the height of the tree. This is due to the recursion stack. In the worst case, for a full binary tree, h can be log(n) if the tree is balanced, but in the worst case, it could be O(n).
